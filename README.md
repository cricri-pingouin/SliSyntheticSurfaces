# SliSyntheticSurfaces
Draw Bezier/B-Splines surfaces, and generate G code to CNC machine them. Written in Turbo C++ as my BEng final year project.

My last commits were just fixing typos: I originally lost the code, and scanned it back from a copy of my report. OCR can be reasonably good, but it's not THAT good! So I just noticed that it misinterpreted some "1" for "l"! It became obvious when drawing the wireframe.
Hopefully, I've fixed a bug in the CNC G code generation too, which I didn't test.
If you spot anything you think is weird, let me know, and that might be an artefact of the OCR as well.
Thanks!
